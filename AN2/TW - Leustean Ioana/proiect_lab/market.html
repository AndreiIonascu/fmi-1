		<h2>Commercial impact</h2>
		<p>In late 2002, 2-megapixel cameras were available in the United States for less than $100, with some 1-megapixel cameras for under $60. At the same time, many discount stores with photo labs introduced a "digital front end", allowing consumers to obtain true chemical prints (as opposed to ink-jet prints) in an hour. These prices were similar to those of prints made from film negatives. However, because digital images have a different aspect ratio than 35 mm film images, people have started to realize that 4x6 inch prints crop some of the image off the print. Some photofinishers have started offering prints with the same aspect ratio as the digital cameras record.</p>
		<p>In July 2003, digital cameras entered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_camera">disposable camera</a> market with the release of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritz_Dakota_Digital">Ritz Dakota Digital</a>, a 1.2-megapixel (1280 x 960) CMOS-based digital camera costing only $11 (USD). Following the familiar single-use concept long in use with film cameras, Ritz intended the Dakota Digital for single use. When the pre-programmed 25-picture limit is reached, the camera is returned to the store, and the consumer receives back prints and a CD-ROM with their photos. The camera is then refurbished and resold.</p>
		<p>Since the introduction of the Dakota Digital, a number of similar single-use digital cameras have appeared. Most single-use digital cameras are nearly identical to the original Dakota Digital in specifications and function, though a few include superior specifications and more advanced functions (such as higher image resolutions and LCD screens). Most, if not all these single-use digital cameras cost less than $20 (USD), not including processing. However, the huge demand for complex digital cameras at competitive prices has often caused manufacturing shortcuts, evidenced by a large increase in customer complaints over camera malfunctions, high parts prices, and short service life. Some digital cameras offer only a 90-day warranty.</p>
		<p>Since 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras. Prices of 35mm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_camera">compact cameras</a> have dropped with manufacturers further <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing">outsourcing</a> to countries such as China. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak">Kodak</a> announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_world">developed world</a>. In January 2006, Nikon followed suit and announced they would stop production of all but two models of their film cameras. They will continue to produce the low-end <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FM10">Nikon FM10</a>, and the high-end <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_F6">Nikon F6</a>. In the same month, Konica Minolta announced it was pulling out of the camera business altogether. The price of 35mm and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Photo_System">APS (Advanced Photo System)</a> compact cameras have dropped, probably due to direct competition from digital and the resulting growth of the offer of second-hand film cameras. Pentax have reduced production of film cameras but not halted it. The technology has improved so rapidly that one of Kodak's film cameras was discontinued before it was awarded a "camera of the year" award later in the year. The decline in film camera sales has also led to a decline in purchases of film for such cameras. In November 2004, a German division of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agfa-Gevaert">Agfa-Gevaert</a>, AgfaPhoto, split off. Within six months it filed for bankruptcy. Konica Minolta Photo Imaging, Inc. ended production of Color film and paper worldwide by March 31, 2007. In addition, by 2005, Kodak employed less than a third of the employees it had twenty years earlier. It is not known if these job losses in the film industry have been offset in the digital image industry. Digital cameras have decimated the film photography industry through declining use of the expensive film rolls and development chemicals previously required to develop the photos. This has had a dramatic effect on companies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujifilm">Fuji</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak">Kodak</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agfa">Agfa</a>. Many stores that formerly offered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photofinishing">photofinishing</a> services or sold film no longer do, or have seen a tremendous decline. In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.</p>
		<p>In addition, digital photography has resulted in some positive market impacts as well. The increasing popularity of products such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photo_frame">digital photo frames</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_print">canvas prints</a> is a direct result of the increasing popularity of digital photography.</p>
		<p>Digital camera sales peaked in March 2012 averaging about 11 million units a month, but sales have declined significantly ever since. By March 2014, about 3 million were purchased each month, about 30 percent of the peak sales total. The decline may have bottomed out, with sales average hovering around 3 million a month. The main competitor is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone">smartphones</a>, most of which have built-in digital cameras, which routinely get better. They also offer the ability to record videos.</p>

		<h2>Social impact</h2>
		<p>Until the advent of the digital camera, amateur photographers could either buy print or slide film for their cameras. Slides could be developed and shown to an audience using a slide projector. Digital photography revolutionized the industry by eliminating the delay and cost. The ease of viewing, transferring, editing and distributing allowed consumers to manage their digital photos with ordinary home computers rather than specialized equipment.</p>
		<p>Camera phones, being the majority of cameras, have arguably the largest impact. The user can set their Smartphones to upload their products to the Internet, preserving them even if the camera is destroyed or the images deleted. Some high street photography shops have self-service kiosks that allow images to be printed directly from smartphones via Bluetooth technology.</p>
		<p>Archivists and historians have noticed the transitory nature of digital media. Unlike film and print, which are tangible and immediately accessible to a person, digital image storage is ever-changing, with old media and decoding software becoming obsolete or inaccessible by new technologies. Historians are concerned that we are creating a historical void where information and details about an era would have been lost within either failed or inaccessible digital media. They recommend that professional and amateur users develop strategies for digital preservation by migrating stored digital images from old technologies to new. Scrapbookers who may have used film for creating artistic and personal memoirs may need to modify their approach to digital photo books to personalize them and retain the special qualities of traditional photo albums.</p>
		<p>The web has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992 (an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes). Today photo sharing sites such as Flickr, Picasa and PhotoBucket, as well as social Web sites, are used by millions of people to share their pictures.</p>
